Avoid billable Nous services (browser, image gen, TTS, Firecrawl, GroktoCrawl); use free OpenRouter when possible.
§
`mike` profile is the designated home for all DABT work. User prefers workflow audits and reviews to be delivered as kanban cards with concrete system examples.
§
User may abandon Hermes if quality issues continue (stated 2026-06-07). Prefers stability over new features when degraded.
§
When user requests execution without analysis, execute immediately without menus. Expected behavior: run commands, return outcomes. Avoid pre-flight explanations before execution.
§
Artifact governance for Hermes: session JSON older than cutoff should be gzip-compressed into ~/backups/archive/old-sessions/ with protected files (sessions.json, sessions.db) excluded. Config backups should be pruned to the latest 1. Weekly cron-driven cleanup is preferred over ad hoc analysis-only responses.
§
User prefers extremely clean directories - no temp files, orphan dirs, merged folders. Delete .hms-bak and cleanup aggressively.
§
Profile ownership and isolation rules remain.
§
User expects default profile to act as orchestrator with controlled, audited, one-way capability to push skills into isolated profiles (jacob, mike, euphy) without unrestricted access. Created orchestrator-profile-skill-pusher skill for this purpose. Strict 5-profile isolation model must be preserved.
§
User dislikes repetitive sign-offs, recurring phrases, and responses that feel cut off or incomplete. Prefers direct, non-repetitive output.
§
When user requests analysis of a specific text, read the primary source first and use direct quotes. Do not produce abstract framework-only analysis without source grounding.
§
User values session history as recoverable memory — reacted to deletion as "months worth of memories gone." Comprehensive Hermes backup repo exists at `/root/work` with config, skills, DABT, Vietnam research, trading, and notes spanning at least 2026-05-18→2026-06-07. Archived Hermes session files are stored in `~/.hermes/backups/archive/old-sessions/` and can be restored as `.jsonl` files into the active session store.
