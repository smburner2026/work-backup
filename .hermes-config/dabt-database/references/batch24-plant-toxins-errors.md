## Wrong-Standard-Answers (DB contradicts textbook toxicology)

These questions have a stored answer that disagrees with established plant toxicology from Casarett & Doull Ch.26.

### DABT-1371 — Linamarin classification

**Question:** "Linamarin is a/an _____."
**Options:** A: pyrrolizidine alkaloid, B: cardioactive glycoside, C: cyanogenic glucoside, D: fungal metabolite
**DB answer:** E (none of the above)
**Casarett & Doull (Ch.26, Cyanogens section):** "Cassava…contains a cyanogenic glucoside **linamarin** that degrades during processing."
**Assessment:** Linamarin IS a cyanogenic glucoside (option C). The "none of the above" designation is likely a DB error.

### DABT-1376 — Toxin in potatoes and tomatoes

**Question:** "A toxin present in potatoes and tomatoes is _____."
**Options:** A: colchicine, B: vinblastine, C: solanine, D: podophyllotoxin
**DB answer:** A (colchicine)
**Casarett & Doull (Ch.26):** *Solanum* species contain "the glycoalkaloid **solanine**." Colchicine is from *Colchicum autumnale* (autumn crocus).
**Assessment:** Wrong. Solanine (C) is textbook-correct. Colchicine is found in autumn crocus, not Solanaceae.

### DABT-1379 — Monomethylhydrazine source

**Question:** "Monomethylhydrazine is found in _____."
**Options:** A: algae, B: lichens, C: ferns, D: mushrooms
**DB answer:** A (algae)
**Casarett & Doull (Ch.26):** False morel (*Gyromitra esculenta*) contains gyromitrin → hydrolyzed to **monomethylhydrazine (MMH)**.
**Assessment:** Wrong. MMH comes from false morel mushrooms (D), not algae.

### DABT-1381 — Oxalate in rhubarb/philodendron

**Question:** "Rhubarb, mother-in-law's tongue, and philodendron all contain _____."
**Options:** A: oxalate, B: cyanide, C: nicotine, D: atropine
**DB answer:** E (none of the above)
**Casarett & Doull (Ch.26):** Table 26-4 lists Dieffenbachia (dumbcane), Philodendron, Rheum (rhubarb) among plants that cause GI irritation "due to release of raphides of **oxalates**."
**Assessment:** Likely wrong. All three plants contain oxalates (option A). The E answer contradicts Ch.26.

### DABT-1393 — Belladonna alkaloid manifestations

**Question:** "All of the following are manifestations of belladonna alkaloid poisoning except _____."
**Options:** A: dry mouth, B: dilated pupils, C: hallucinations, D: bronchospasm
**DB answer:** C (hallucinations)
**Casarett & Doull (Ch.26, Parasympathetic Block):** "Large doses can cause confusion, bizarre behavior, **hallucinations**, and subsequent amnesia" (line 1180).
**Assessment:** Likely wrong. Hallucinations ARE a known manifestation of severe anticholinergic poisoning. Bronchospasm (D) is the actual exception — anticholinergics cause bronchodilation.

### DABT-1396 — Ricin source

**Question:** "Ricin comes from _____."
**Options:** A: lily of the valley, B: castor bean plant, C: oleander, D: wisteria
**DB answer:** A (lily of the valley)
**Casarett & Doull (Ch.26, Toxalbumins):** "Two toxins…**ricin I and ricin II**… *Ricinus communis* seeds."
**Assessment:** Wrong. Ricin comes from castor bean (B). Lily of the valley contains cardiac glycosides.

### DABT-1397 — Heart-affecting alkaloids exception

**Question:** "All of the following produce alkaloids that affect the heart except _____."
**Options:** A: European hellebore, B: monkshood, C: petunia, D: rhododendron
**DB answer:** B (monkshood)
**Casarett & Doull (Ch.26, Aconitine):** *Aconitum* (monkshood) produces aconitine causing "prolonged sodium current with slowed repolarization in **cardiac muscle**."
**Assessment:** Wrong. Monkshood (aconitine) definitively affects the heart. Petunia (C) is the actual exception.

### DABT-1398 — Saint Anthony's fire source

**Question:** "Saint Anthony's fire is produced by _____."
**Options:** A: arsenic, B: Claviceps purpurea, C: false morel mushrooms, D: Lantana camara
**DB answer:** C (false morel mushrooms)
**Casarett & Doull (Ch.26, Vasoactive Chemicals):** "Ingestion of the fungus **Claviceps purpurea (ergot)**… Ergot poisoning was called 'St. Anthony's fire' due to the blackened appearance of the limbs" (lines 791-795).
**Assessment:** Wrong. Ergotism (Claviceps purpurea, B) is Saint Anthony's fire. False morels cause gyromitrin/MMH poisoning.

### DABT-1400 — Factors affecting plant toxin variability

**Question:** "All of the following contribute to the variability in toxin produced by a plant except _____."
**Options:** A: varying toxin concentration in different plant parts, B: age of the plant, C: climate and soil, D: type of local herbivore
**DB answer:** B (age of the plant)
**Casarett & Doull (Ch.26, Introduction):** "Many variables: what part of the plant, **the age of the plant**, amount of sunlight and soil quality, and genetic differences within a species."
**Assessment:** Wrong. The chapter EXPLICITLY includes plant age as a variable. D (type of local herbivore) is the real exception.

### DABT-1404 — 4-Ipomeanol toxicity target

**Question:** "4-ipomeanol causes which type of toxicity in animals?"
**Options:** A: liver and pancreatic, B: lung and renal, C: heart and muscle, D: neurologic
**DB answer:** A (liver and pancreatic)
**Casarett & Doull (Ch.26):** "The **pneumotoxin, 4-ipomeanol**" — classic lung toxin activated by CYP4B1 in Clara cells.
**Assessment:** Wrong. 4-ipomeanol is a CLASSIC pneumotoxin. Option B (lung and renal) is closer; A directly contradicts the textbook.

### DABT-1406 — Alpha-amanitin effect

**Question:** "Alpha-amanitian _____."
**Options:** A: is responsible for the diarrhea seen in death cap poisoning, B: is poorly absorbed orally, C: is a potent inhibitor of hepatic protein synthesis, D: none of the above
**DB answer:** A (is responsible for the diarrhea)
**Casarett & Doull (Ch.26, lines 846-861):** α-Amanitin "inhibits **protein synthesis in hepatocytes** by binding to RNA polymerase II." Phalloidin (not α-amanitin) causes GI effects.
**Assessment:** Wrong. Diarrhea is from phalloidin. α-Amanitin inhibits hepatic protein synthesis (C is the correct statement).

### DABT-1407 — Aflatoxin effects

**Question:** "Aflatoxins are dangerous to humans because they _____."
**Options:** A: are present in wet basements, B: cause pneumonia in AIDS patients, C: are associated with nasal carcinoma, D: none of the above
**DB answer:** B (cause pneumonia in AIDS patients)
**Casarett & Doull (Ch.26, Mycotoxins):** "Aflatoxin B1…form guanine adducts and induce apoptosis in human hepatocytes." IARC Group 1 — hepatocarcinogen.
**Assessment:** Wrong. Aflatoxin is a hepatocarcinogen, not a cause of pneumonia. D (none of the above) would be most defensible.

### DABT-1409 — Grayanotoxin true statement

**Question:** "All of the following are true of grayanotoxins except _____."
**Options:** A: They are present in rhododendron., B: They can contaminate honey., C: They cause bradycardia., D: They block the neuromuscular junction.
**DB answer:** A (They are present in rhododendron)
**Casarett & Doull (Ch.26, Grayanotoxins):** "Grayanotoxins are produced exclusively by several genera of Ericaceae…in particular found in **Rhododendron ponticum**."
**Assessment:** Wrong. Statement A IS true. D (block NMJ) is NOT true — grayanotoxins bind cardiac Na channels, not NMJ.

### DABT-1415 — Milk-transmitted plant toxin

**Question:** "A plant toxin that can be highly transmitted through milk is _____."
**Options:** A: oxalate, B: cyanide, C: nitrate, D: tremetol
**DB answer:** C (nitrate)
**Casarett & Doull (Ch.26, White Snakeroot):** White snakeroot contains tremetone; humans drinking milk "get 'milk sickness'…attributed to tremetone."
**Assessment:** Wrong. Tremetol/tremetone (D) is THE classic milk-transmitted plant toxin. Nitrate is not.

## Letter-E Corruptions (9 items)

These questions have `correct_answer_letter = "E"` but only options A-D stored.

| ID | DB Answer | Options A–D | Verdict |
|----|-----------|-------------|---------|
| DABT-1371 | E | pyrrolizidine alkaloid, cardioactive glycoside, cyanogenic glucoside, fungal metabolite | **Wrong** — linamarin IS a cyanogenic glucoside (C) |
| DABT-1373 | E | henbane, oleander, deadly nightshade, jimsonweed | **Debatable** — if the exception is "all contain anticholinergic alkaloids except," oleander (B) is clearly the exception. E is questionable |
| DABT-1381 | E | oxalate, cyanide, nicotine, atropine | **Wrong** — all three plants contain oxalate (A) |
| DABT-1383 | E | adults, children, diabetics, asthmatics | **Plausible** — raw mushrooms can be toxic to all |
| DABT-1384 | E | hepatic, pancreatic, cardiac toxicity, dermatitis | **Plausible** — all are common; "least common" is ambiguous |
| DABT-1392 | E | liver, brain, kidney, intestinal pathology | **Plausible** — all occur in *Amanita* poisoning |
| DABT-1405 | E | Amanita, Gyromitra, Galerina, Lepiota | **Wrong** — ALL four genera cause fatalities; question may be flawed |
| DABT-1408 | E | American hellebore, bracken fern, buttercup, tung nut | **Wrong** — bracken fern IS carcinogenic |
| DABT-1410 | E | alkaloids, terpenes, resins, glycosides | **Wrong** — definition perfectly describes alkaloids (A) |

## Foundational Classification Errors (DABT-1410 to DABT-1412)

### DABT-1410 — Definition of alkaloids

**Question:** "Plant molecules that react as bases and usually contain nitrogen in a heterocyclic structure are known as _____."
**Options:** A: alkaloids, B: terpenes, C: resins, D: glycosides
**DB answer:** E (none of the above)
**Casarett & Doull (Ch.26, Table 26-2):** Alkaloids are the class fitting this definition
**Assessment:** Wrong. This is the textbook definition of alkaloids (A). Clear DB error.

### DABT-1411 — Definition of terpenes

**Question:** "Plant molecules that are created from isoprene units with varying functional groups are known as _____."
**Options:** A: terpenes, B: amines, C: alkaloids, D: phenols
**DB answer:** B (amines)
**Casarett & Doull (Ch.26, Table 26-2):** Isoprene building blocks = terpenes
**Assessment:** Wrong. This defines terpenes (A). Amines are nitrogen-containing compounds.

### DABT-1412 — Definition of glycosides

**Question:** "Plant molecules that are hydrolyzed to a sugar and a nonsugar moiety are known as _____."
**Options:** A: glycosides, B: alkaloids, C: resins, D: terpene
**DB answer:** A (glycosides)
**Assessment:** ✅ Correct.

## Key Patterns

1. **Systematic reversal of basic plant toxin facts (13/50 = 26% error rate)** — Fundamental errors: ricin source, solanine in Solanaceae, aconitine cardiotoxicity, aflatoxin carcinogenicity, bracken fern carcinogenicity, ergot as St. Anthony's fire. These are not nuanced.

2. **Three foundational classification questions (DABT-1410-1412): 2/3 wrong** — Alkaloids and terpenes definitions are textbook-standard; errors suggest poor extraction quality for the entire section.

3. **"Except" questions consistently designate TRUE statements as the exception** (DABT-1393, 1397, 1400, 1409). Same pattern seen in immunotoxicology (batch9) and pesticides (batch19).

4. **Letter-E corruption rate: 18%** (9/50). Of these, at least 5 are demonstrably wrong (DABT-1371, 1381, 1405, 1408, 1410). The remaining 4 are plausible "none of the above" answers.

5. **Reference chapter is single and self-contained:** All 50 questions are covered by Casarett & Doull Ch.26 alone — simpler verification than multi-chapter batches.
