# Batch 13 Neurotoxicology DB Answer Discrepancies

Batch: DABT-0869 through DABT-0918 (50 questions)
Source: 2000Q Bank (source_file_id=2)
Domain: All Domain IV — Neurotoxicology
Date processed: 2026-05-20

## Summary

This batch covers **neurotoxicology** exclusively — 50 questions on neuronopathy/axonopathy/myelinopathy patterns, axonal transport, brain energy metabolism, circumventricular organs, tardive dyskinesia, MPTP/MPP⁺ mechanism, solvent neurotoxicity, metal neurotoxicity (lead, arsenic, mercury, manganese, aluminum), drug-induced neuropathies (statins, nitrous oxide, metronidazole, aminoglycosides), OP poisoning, cocaine/amphetamine neurotoxicity, HIV-associated dementia, and clinical evaluation of neurotoxicity.

29 out of 50 questions (58%) have DB answer key errors — the highest error rate seen in any batch processed so far. Errors include: (1) `correct_answer_letter='E'` while options only go up to D, (2) DB answer contradicts Casarett & Doull Ch.16 neurotoxicology, (3) matching-test items with completely wrong associations, and (4) fundamental neurobiology reversals.

## Category 1: Answer "E" with no E option (options only A-D)

Same CSV extraction error seen in prior batches. `correct_answer_letter='E'` while `answer_options` only has A-D.

| QID | Question | DB Answer | Correct Answer | Rationale |
|-----|----------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| DABT-0878 | Advantage of developing NS over adult | E (none) | **E valid** (all listed are false) | Developing NS has GREATER sensitivity, slower recovery, LEAKER BBB — none of the listed advantages hold (C&D Ch.16) |
| DABT-0879 | Associated with neuronopathies EXCEPT | E (none) | **E valid** (none are the exception) | All listed toxicants (cyanide, organic mercury, doxorubicin, gold) can cause neuronopathies (C&D Ch.16) |
| DABT-0880 | Aminoglycoside neurotoxicity | E (hearing loss) | **E valid** (hearing loss) | Aminoglycosides are ototoxic — selective damage to cochlear hair cells (C&D Ch.16) |
| DABT-0883 | Toxicant-toxicity pair EXCEPT | E | **A** (aluminum-nystagmus) | Aluminum causes dialysis encephalopathy, NOT nystagmus (C&D Ch.16) |
| DABT-0894 | MPP⁺ transport system | E | **C** (dopamine transporter/DAT) | MPP⁺ enters dopaminergic neurons via the dopamine transporter (C&D Ch.16) |
| DABT-0896 | Promotes microtubule formation | E | **D** (paclitaxel) | Paclitaxel stabilizes/promotes microtubules; vinca alkaloids cause depolymerization (C&D Ch.16) |
| DABT-0900 | Main excitatory neurotransmitter | E (none of the above) | **D valid** (glutamate not listed) | Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter — not listed among A-C, so D is technically correct (C&D Ch.16) |
| DABT-0906 | Least useful in neurotoxicity evaluation | E (aspartate transaminase) | **E valid** | AST is a liver enzyme — no role in neurotoxicity eval (C&D Ch.16) |

## Category 2: DB answer contradicts established neurotoxicology

| QID | Question | DB Answer | Correct Answer | Rationale |
|-----|----------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| DABT-0875 | Purpose of circumventricular organs | **C** (allow neuronal hypertrophy) | **D** (respond to blood hormone levels) | CVOs lack tight BBB → sense blood hormones. They do NOT mediate neuronal hypertrophy (C&D Ch.16) |
| DABT-0877 | Tardive dyskinesia cause | **C** (amphetamines) | **B** (phenothiazines) | Classic tardive dyskinesia from chronic antipsychotics (phenothiazines/D₂ blockers). Amphetamines cause acute dyskinesia (C&D Ch.16) |
| DABT-0885 | Incorrect toxicant-toxic result pair | **D** (dapsone-peripheral neuropathy) | **C** (colchicine-blindness) | Dapsone DOES cause peripheral neuropathy (motor axonopathy). Colchicine causes neuropathy, but blindness is not its classic presentation (C&D Ch.16) |
| DABT-0886 | Incorrect toxicant-association pair | **C** (acrylamide-peripheral neuropathy) | **A** (CS₂-waltzing syndrome debatable) or none | Acrylamide IS a classic cause of peripheral neuropathy. All listed pairs are actually correct. CS₂-waltzing syndrome is a real animal finding (C&D Ch.16) |
| DABT-0888 | Cocaine neurotoxicity mechanism | **A** (cholinergic receptor blockade) | **C** (alteration in striatal dopamine transmission) | Cocaine blocks DAT → increased DA transmission. Not primarily cholinergic (C&D Ch.16) |
| DABT-0889 | Hepatic encephalopathy cause | **D** (glutathione) | **A** (ammonia) | Hyperammonemia is the principal cause. Astrocytes convert excess NH₃ → glutamine → edema (C&D Ch.16) |
| DABT-0891 | Fluoroacetate exposure source | **B** (Freon) | **C** (5-fluorouracil) | Casarett states: "Exposure to FA may also occur via exposure to the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil" (C&D Ch.16) |
| DABT-0893 | Chinese restaurant syndrome cause | **B** (glycine) | **D** (glutamate/MSG) | Chinese restaurant syndrome is caused by monosodium glutamate (MSG), not glycine (C&D Ch.16; Clinical Toxicology) |
| DABT-0895 | Axonopathy first sites affected | **C** (cranial nerves) | **D** (distal parts of hands and feet) | Distal axonopathies first affect the LONGEST axons → stocking-glove distribution. Cranial nerves not first (C&D Ch.16) |
| DABT-0897 | Hexachlorophene mechanism | **B** (Wallerian degeneration) | **D** (intramyelinic edema) | Hexachlorophene causes intramyelinic edema → spongiosis. Wallerian degeneration is post-axotomy (C&D Ch.16) |
| DABT-0898 | Classified as amphetamine | **C** (phenylephrine) | **A** (MDMA) | MDMA = 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine = substituted amphetamine. Phenylephrine is an α₁-agonist decongestant (C&D Ch.16) |
| DABT-0901 | MPTP converting enzyme | **B** (MAO-A) | **A** (MAO-B) | Casarett: "MPTP is a substrate for MAO-B" in astrocytes. MAO-B blockers (selegiline) prevent conversion (C&D Ch.16) |
| DABT-0902 | Solvent neurotoxicity correlation | **D** (none of the above) | **C** (lipid solubility, air-olive oil partition coefficient) | CNS solvent neurotoxicity correlates with lipid solubility/BBB penetration (C&D Ch.16, 24) |
| DABT-0903 | Trigeminal neuropathy cause | **A** (benzene) | **D** (trichloroethylene) | TCE is the classic cause of trigeminal neuropathy. Benzene is primarily hematotoxic (C&D Ch.16, 24) |
| DABT-0907 | Acute organophosphate effects | **D** (sympathetic overstimulation) | **B** (muscarinic + nicotinic overstimulation) | OP → AChE inhibition → ACh excess → both muscarinic (SLUDGE) and nicotinic (fasciculations, weakness) effects (C&D Ch.16, 22) |
| DABT-0908 | True about neurotoxic agent EXCEPT | **A** (focal/asymmetric syndrome) | **A** — DB answer IS correct | Neurotoxic exposures produce SYMMETRIC syndromes. Focal = structural cause. Note: DB says A is the exception, and A is correct as the false statement |
| DABT-0909 | Toxicant + age-related attrition EXCEPT | **B** (ALS) | **C** (multiple sclerosis) | MS is autoimmune/demyelinating, NOT a toxicant + age-related attrition model. ALS and PD do have environmental components with age (C&D Ch.16) |
| DABT-0910 | Statins + ethanol shared toxicity | **D** (neurotransmitter-associated toxicity) | **C** (myopathy) | Both statins and ethanol cause myopathy (muscle toxicity). Statin myopathy via CoQ10 depletion; ethanol myopathy via mitochondrial damage (C&D Ch.16, 33) |
| DABT-0913 | CNS myelin-forming cell | **A** (Schwann cell) | **B** (oligodendrocyte) | Schwann cells = PNS myelin. Oligodendrocytes = CNS myelin. Fundamental neurobiology (C&D Ch.16) |
| DABT-0915 | n-Hexane identical axonopathy | **A** (methylmercury) | **C** (methyl n-butyl ketone) | MnBK produces the identical axonopathy via same metabolite 2,5-hexanedione. MeHg causes neuronopathy, not axonopathy (C&D Ch.16) |
| DABT-0918 | Primary defense cell in CNS | **C** (oligodendrocyte) | **A** (astrocyte) | Astrocytes are the primary CNS defense: glutathione supply, glutamate uptake, metal sequestration, BBB maintenance (C&D Ch.16) |

## Category 3: Matching test items with wrong associations

DABT-0869 to DABT-0871 are single-option matching items where the DB has entirely wrong pairings.

| QID | Term | DB Match | Correct Match | Rationale |
|-----|------|----------|---------------|-----------|
| DABT-0869 | Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) | Eggshell calcification | **Silo filler's disease (pulmonary edema)** | NO₂ → chemical pneumonitis. Eggshell calcification = silicosis/silica (C&D Ch.15, 24) |
| DABT-0870 | Beryllium | Emphysema, cor pulmonale | **Chronic beryllium disease (granulomatous lung)** | Beryllium → granulomatous interstitial lung disease (sarcoid-like). Emphysema = α₁-AT deficiency/smoking (C&D Ch.15) |
| DABT-0871 | PTFE combustion | Nasal SCC | **Polymer fume fever (Teflon flu)** | PTFE pyrolysis → polymer fume fever (acute flu-like). Nasal SCC = nickel/wood dust (C&D Ch.15, 24) |

### Key Insights

1. **100% error rate in matching test items:** All 3 matching questions (DABT-0869, 0870, 0871) have wrong chemical→effect associations. Pattern extends from batches 6 (antidotes), 7 (general principles), and 12 (lung disease) — the 2000Q Bank matching tests are systematically scrambled.

2. **MPTP/dopamine questions are all wrong:** 4 questions (DABT-0894, 0896, 0901, 0898) all contradict the textbook. MPTP converted by MAO-B (not MAO-A), MPP⁺ enters via dopamine transporter (not glucose/amino acid system), paclitaxel promotes microtubules (not E), MDMA is an amphetamine (not phenylephrine).

3. **Fundamental neurobiology reversals:** DB has Schwann cell → CNS myelin (wrong — that's PNS), oligodendrocyte → CNS defense (wrong — that's astrocyte), cranial nerves → first in axonopathy (wrong — stocking-glove pattern).

4. **Clinical pharmacology errors:** Tardive dyskinesia → amphetamines (wrong — phenothiazines), Chinese restaurant syndrome → glycine (wrong — MSG), hepatic encephalopathy → glutathione (wrong — ammonia).

5. **Multiple overlapping errors on same topics:** Neurotransmitter/receptor questions and drug-induced neuropathology have high error rates that track together — the 2000Q Bank appears to have systematically misaligned answer keys across neuropharmacology topics.

6. **Questions that ARE correct** tend to be basic structural/energy concepts (axonal transport, neuronopathy definition, brain energy metabolism, clinical evaluation) — these are topics less dependent on drug-specific associations.

### Structural Quirk: Matching-type Single-Option Items

Some questions in this batch (DABT-0869, 0870, 0871) have only **one answer option stored** in the `answer_options` table — just the correct answer letter and its text. These likely originated from a matching test format (left column = chemical, right column = effect) that was imported with the correct pairing but lost the distractor options. When encountering such questions:
- **Do NOT assume the DB pairing is correct** — the 2000Q Bank matching tests have a >90% error rate across all batches examined
- **Reconstruct the correct association** from Casarett & Doull rather than accepting the stored match
- **Flag the discrepancy** in the explanation as "DB-stated match is X (a likely data error in the database)"

## Recommendations for Future Neurotoxicology Batches

1. **Always verify against Casarett & Doull Ch.16** before accepting any DB answer for neurotoxicology questions — this chapter covers: neuropathological patterns (neuronopathy, axonopathy, myelinopathy), axonal transport, BBB and circumventricular organs, energy metabolism, neurotransmitter systems, metal neurotoxicity, organic solvent neurotoxicity, MPTP/parkinsonism, drug-induced neuropathies, developmental neurotoxicology, and clinical evaluation.

2. **Treat ALL matching-test questions (single-word stems) with extreme suspicion** — especially if the answer_option table has only 1 row. The 2000Q Bank matching tests are systematically corrupted.

3. **Cross-check MPTP/MPP⁺ questions carefully** — both the biochemical conversion (MAO-B, not MAO-A) and the transport mechanism (DAT, not glucose/amino acid) are frequently wrong in the DB.

4. **Know the myelin cell distinction:** Schwann cell = PNS myelin; oligodendrocyte = CNS myelin. This is the single most fundamental neurobiology fact and the DB gets it wrong.

5. **Remember distal axonopathy pattern:** Longest axons affected first → stocking-glove distribution (feet before hands, hands before cranial). NOT cranial nerves first.

6. **Reference text location:** All neurotoxicology explanations should cite Casarett & Doull Ch.16 (Toxic Responses of the Nervous System, pp.858-895) as the primary source. For metals, supplement with Ch.23 (Toxic Effects of Metals). For solvents, supplement with Ch.24 (Toxic Effects of Solvents and Vapors). For pesticides/OPs, supplement with Ch.22.

7. **When a DB answer has `correct_answer_letter='E'` but only A-D options exist**, do NOT assign it to a letter — instead determine the correct answer from the reference text and explain the discrepancy. The E answer is a CSV extraction artifact.
